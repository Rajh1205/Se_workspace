1. rand() — Generates a random number

rand() is a C library function that returns a pseudo-random integer between 0 and RAND_MAX (usually 32767).

But if you call rand() directly, you’ll get the same sequence of numbers every time the program runs.


2. srand(time(0)) — Sets the seed for randomness

srand() means “seed random” — it initializes the random number generator.

time(0) gives the current system time in seconds since 1970 (Unix time).

So every time you run the program, time(0) is different → the random sequence changes.

This ensures a different lucky number every time you run your program.


3. (rand() % 100) — Limits range from 0 to 99

% is the modulus operator → it gives the remainder after division.

So rand() % 100 will always give a number between 0 and 99.

That’s your lucky number range.


🔸 Example:

If internally rand() returns:

rand() → 12345


then:

12345 % 100 = 45


So your lucky number becomes 45.
